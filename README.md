# Full Stack Chat Application with embedchain Integration

## Overview

This chat application is a full stack solution that leverages the power of the `embedchain` Python package. Built using Flask for the backend and Next.js for the frontend, it provides an interactive user-bot chat experience. Users can upload PDF and text files, which are integrated into the `embedchain` bot as data sources.

## Key Features

- **File Upload**: Users can upload PDF and text files to integrate them as data sources for the bot.
- **embedchain Integration**: Files are automatically integrated into the `embedchain` bot using the `.add()` method.
- **User-Bot Chat**: Engage in real-time chat with the bot, querying the data sources using the `.query()` functionality.
